must have: front end ui for all elements.
    what elements do I have? 
        setting up a Spa with:
            login pages
            create account page 
            page for managers to manage permissions and access of users.
            i need a page to manage the CRUD of all inventory with search and dislpay by functionality
            pick lists page.
        
            so at least: Login, create account, permissions, inventory

    i have the project going, currently i have a front end login setup with 
    username and password.
    i set it up with a submit button for an api call to the backend to use
    the username and pass to get a token to the front.

    on the backend Ive started setting up models, views, serializers and urls.
        i set up the profile model with an is_staff bool.
        the idea is to be able to display the users profiles by name and change
        their permissions. maybe even have a user page with employee info and 
        stats.
